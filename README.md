# FOREST TYPE CLASSIFICATION
**Classify forest types based on information about the area**

## Project Description
This is a competition project hosted on [Kaggle.com](www.Kaggle.com)

In this project we’ll predict what types of trees there are in an area based on various geographic features.

## Data Set
The datasets comes from a study conducted in four wilderness areas within the beautiful Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with very little human disturbances – the existing forest cover types there are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.
The data is in raw form and contains categorical data such as wilderness areas and soil type.
